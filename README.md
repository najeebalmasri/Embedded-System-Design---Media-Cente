## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Use Keil uVision to open the project files.
3. Connect the LPC1768 board and download the code to the hardware.
4. Use the joystick to navigate through the system.

## Code Files

1. **`Blinky.c`**: Contains the main menu and initialization code.
2. **`PhotoViewer.c`**: Handles photo viewing functionality.
3. **`Audio.c`**: Implements the MP3 audio player with volume control.
4. **`Snake.c`**: Implements the Snake game.
5. **`Memory.c`**: Implements the Memory game.
